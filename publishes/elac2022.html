  <h3><b>DAY 1</b></h3>
   <p>&nbsp&nbspWith the bustling aura of a busy school and excited students who can be seen across the campus, we, at last, announce the start of ELAC 2022!
<br>&nbsp&nbspStarting it off simply with a <b>short story</b> and <b>essay writing</b> in rooms 102 and 103, simultaneously a competition of <b>extemporaneous speech</b> is held in the library for students from grades 7 to 9.
<br>&nbsp&nbspIn a room filled with creative minds and imaginations soaring uncontrollably, students have created wonderful and story-rich essays based on the prompts they were given for essay writing.
<br>&nbsp&nbspBack in the library, extemporaneous speech participants were asked to choose a random topic from a cup and a limited time was given for them to prepare. The students one after another gave great speeches and answered the judge's questions with ease.
<br>&nbsp&nbspComing to the <i>second half</i> of the day, students from grades 10, 11, and 12 competed in another <b>extemporaneous speech</b> event whereas collaborative writing was given to our junior students from grades 5 and 6.</p>

   <p>&nbsp&nbspThe first <b>spelling bee</b> started with the registration of participating students from grades 1 to 5 and <b>debates</b> for grades 5 to 6.
   <br>&nbsp&nbspAs each round goes on, dodging the disqualifications, our young contestants move on and continue to push through.
<br>&nbsp&nbspWith great enthusiasm and with high-spirits, students competing in the <b>debate</b> have come from different campuses to participate.
<br>&nbsp&nbspWith the afternoon quickly approaching, the <b>debate</b> for students in grades 7 through 9 and the <b>spelling bee</b> competition for grades 6 to 12 have started without a problem. Round after round, at the end of the day, we are left with the top three performers from each category.</p>

  <h3><b>DAY 3</b></h3>
   <p>&nbsp&nbspThe third day starts strong with young students from all campuses grades 1 and 2 being invited to a <b>poetry recitation</b> competition. After giving a listen to the recitations, the judges narrowed their choices down to <i>three people</i>.
<br>&nbsp&nbspRight after, <b>teams of debaters</b> consisting of students from grades 10 to 12 have given us an interesting look at their opinions and their hard work in their research.
<br>&nbsp&nbspThe day ends with two more competitions. The <b>spoken word poetry contest with the keyword "LOVE";</b> where through careful analysis of rhythm and tone, the top three finishers have been revealed. And the next round of <b>debates</b> for grades 5 through 9 have smoothly passed.</p>
